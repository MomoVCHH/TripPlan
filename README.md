# TripPlan

I created a project on Google Cloud and used Google APIs to develop this app. It has its own database SQLite. 
However, the app is still under development, until now, thee app can show the distance between the origin and the destination (kilometer) and the time, how long does the user need. Later, the app will also have a map and can show users the road, where should he go, from the origin to the destination. 
It will also combine with the FireBase Cloud and this app will also synce with FireBase Cloud. My idea is, the data should always be transferred to the firebase cloud immediately.

So far this product contains three Google APIs, they are are Distance Matrix API, Places API and Android SDK API. 
Receive and send of data through Json and Java HttpURLConnection.
