# TripPlan

I created a project on Google Cloud and used Google APIs to develop this app. It has its own database (SQLite). 
However, the app is still under development, until now, the app has the Address autocomplete function and can show the distance between the origin and the destination (kilometer) and the time, how long does the user need. 

Later, the app will also have a map and can show the user the road, where should he go, from the origin to the destination. 
It will also combine with the FireBase Cloud and this app will also synce with FireBase Cloud. The idea is, the data should always be transferred to the firebase cloud immediately.

So far this app contains three Google APIs, they are are Distance Matrix API, Places API and Android SDK API. 
Receiving and sending of data through Json and Java HttpURLConnection.
